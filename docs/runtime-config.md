# Runtime Config

ADE has one application runtime environment variable:

| Name                         | Required | Used by                        | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTIONSTRING` | Yes      | API, migrations, app container | The application fails fast if SQL is missing or unreachable. |

ADE keeps SQL authentication inside that connection string. Supported values are:

- `SqlPassword` for local SQL Server development.
- `ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity` for explicit managed identity authentication. `User ID` is the optional user-assigned managed identity client ID.
- `ActiveDirectoryDefault` for ADE's passwordless fallback chain. ADE tries `WorkloadIdentityCredential`, then `ManagedIdentityCredential`, then `DeveloperToolsCredential`. When present, `User ID` is used as the client ID for workload and managed identity resolution.

ADE does not add any extra runtime environment variables of its own for that chain, and production infra still uses explicit managed identity mode rather than `ActiveDirectoryDefault`.

ADE does not support a migration-on-startup toggle. `ade-api` never runs migrations on startup, and `ade-migrate` is the only supported migration entrypoint.

ADE keeps runtime HTTP metadata intentionally small:

- `/api/version` returns only `{ service, version }`
- `/metrics` exposes standard Prometheus text metrics for HTTP requests

Build provenance such as image creation time and source revision is stored in OCI image metadata rather than the runtime API.

The server listen address is not environment-driven.

- Local development runs the API on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
- The container image runs the API on `0.0.0.0:8000`.
- If you need a different listen address, pass `--host` and `--port` to `./bin/ade-api`.

`pnpm start` and `pnpm test:acceptance` load `.env` when present and pass only `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTIONSTRING` into the container.

If `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTIONSTRING` is not configured, both commands manage local SQL automatically and synthesize the local container-safe connection string themselves. `pnpm dev` remains host-based and does not read `.env`.
